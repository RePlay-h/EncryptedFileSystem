# Encrypted FileSystem
### Preface
This is my first Python project. It created only for my education. 
It is show my skills in Python (knowledge of basic structures and OOP).
### Description
This project implements functions for encode and decode contents of files. I use a simple algorithm (Caesar's cipher) to encode files.

* emove _file_from_ _file_to_ - copy content of a _file_from_ and encode it, then copy it into _file_to_
* decode _file_ - decode a file and print it into cmd
